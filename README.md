This is the GitHub Repository of Daniel Kushnir.

Note: With each project I become more familiar with the "best practices" in coding, meaning the older the project the less "optimal" the coding is. 
So do not judge my current skills solely based on older projects.

If you have any question regarding the content of my projects, please feel free to contact me at kushnir.daniel05@gmail.com
