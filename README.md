This is the GitHub Repository of Dan K, a current Rutgers University student majoring in Data Science and Computer Science.

Note: With each project I become more familiar with the "best practices" in coding, meaning the older the project the less "optimal" the coding is. 
So I ask that the viewer does not judge my current skills solely based on older projects.
